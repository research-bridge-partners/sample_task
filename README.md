This is a brief coding task. 

In the `src/data` folder, there are two files: `universities.txt` and `sample_sentences.txt`. `universities.txt` contains a list of universities with one university name per line.  `sample_sentences.txt` contains sentences that include references to one or more of the universities, again with one per line.

The purpose of this task is to write a function that reads the two files and returns a count of the number of sentences that contain references to each school. You only need to count references that contain the entire name from `universities.txt`. (For instance, although references to the "University of Texas" usually mean the "University of Texas at Austin", you only need to count references to the longer name.)

When you've completed the contents of `count_occurrences`, running `python src/main.py` should print the number of sentences referencing each university.

Aggressive use of online resources is encouraged.
